# Game of life in WASM ðŸ¦€
This is a small demo of Conway's Game of Life written in Rust using web assembly.

The game cells are stored in wasm memory and represented as a one-dimensional vector. The pointer of the vector is shared to the  javascript runtime in order to render the game state. I've also written a simple abstraction to easily query the
the state of the cells and manage their behaviour.

The project is bundled with the webpack.
